### Art Piece 1

This new media artwork ‘Pleasant Places’ by Quayola was showcased at Bitforms Gallery, known for their collection of new media art, as part of Retrospective exhibit located in San Francisco. This exhibition specifically, was dedicated to showing early new media artists and preserving the value of collecting digital artworks to the art world. Quayola’s work includes a series of digital paintings, in an effort to characterize the relationship between modes of representation and abstraction. He was particularly inspired by Vincent van Gogh, and decided to recreate his landscape paintings of Provence in the modern day. To do so, he travelled to Provence, France and replicated the windblown trees, exploring ways of digitally representing color and texture through the use of pixels rather than paint. With the use of sound, he returns to blurring the binary between representation and abstraction, confusing the audience with the sounds of moving leaves and wind, in distortion from the image. 
The piece was also showcased nearby Duke, at the North Carolina Museum of Art. In the exhibit guide Quayola commented on his artwork: “Through the misuse of image analysis and manipulation algorithms, Pleasant Places challenges the photographic image and proposes alternative modes of vision and synthesis. As the outlines of trees and shrubs get blurred, nature becomes dense and almost impenetrable. The resulting compositions remain, suggestively, suspended between representation and abstraction, between the depth of the natural scenery and the surface of the screen.”
I found this piece extremely visually pleasing and fascinating. I particularly enjoyed the attentiveness in which Quayola replicated van Gogh’s work, but brought a further element through technology innovation in recreating the work to question viewers’ ideas of representation and abstraction.
