This new media artwork ‘Pleasant Places’ by Quayola was showcased at Bitforms Gallery. A gallery known for their collection of new media art,the piece was included in their as Retrospective exhibit held in San Francisco. This exhibition was specifically dedicated to showing early new media artists and preserving the value of collecting digital artworks to the art world. Quayola’s work includes a series of digital paintings, in an effort to characterize the relationship between modes of representation and abstraction. He was particularly inspired by Vincent van Gogh, and decided to recreate his landscape paintings from Provence, France in the modern day. To do so, he travelled to Provence and replicated the windblown trees, exploring ways of digitally representing color and texture through the use of pixels rather than paint. With the use of sound, he returns to blurring the binary between representation and abstraction, confusing the audience with the sounds of moving leaves and wind, in distortion from the image. 

The piece was also showcased nearby Duke, at the North Carolina Museum of Art. In the exhibit guide Quayola commented on his artwork: “Through the misuse of image analysis and manipulation algorithms, Pleasant Places challenges the photographic image and proposes alternative modes of vision and synthesis. As the outlines of trees and shrubs get blurred, nature becomes dense and almost impenetrable. The resulting compositions remain, suggestively, suspended between representation and abstraction, between the depth of the natural scenery and the surface of the screen.”

I found this piece extremely visually pleasing and fascinating. I particularly enjoyed the attentiveness in which Quayola replicated van Gogh’s work, but brought a further element through technological innovation through purposefully reworking the image to question the viewers’ ideas of representation and abstraction.  

### 'Wallpapers' by Sara Ludy

Sara Ludy’s artwork was also featured in the Bitforms Gallery Retrospective exhibit, and after reading about the influence of Ludy  as an emerging new media artist, I decided to research her portfolio further. I found an incredible series titled “Wallpapers” founded in 2011. This project was curated and presented by Ludy. As the title references, it is a project that is concentrated in the significance of a wallpaper, highlighting both its traditional and digital applications – either on a physical wall or the desktop of a digital device. This is executed by displaying both online and offline exhibitions of digital wallpapers. The offline wallpapers typically react to their physical environment in the museum space, with the installation of patterns. Through exploring a focus in the wallpaper and its influence, the project addresses the processes involved in pattern-making and textural elements, and how they relate to computation.
